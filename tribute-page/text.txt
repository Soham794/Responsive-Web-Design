Went to Elphinstone College and then Royal Institute of Science before moving abroad.

🎓 Education and Academic Excellence
Joined Caius College, University of Cambridge in 1927 with the initial aim of studying mechanical engineering.

Shifted to theoretical physics out of deep passion and talent.

Earned a Ph.D. in Physics in 1935, working on quantum theory and cosmic rays.

Worked with legendary physicists like Paul Dirac and Wolfgang Pauli.

🧠 Scientific Achievements
Known for Bhabha Scattering — theoretical work explaining electron-positron interactions.

Contributed significantly to cosmic ray research, advancing the understanding of high-energy particles.

Elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1941 for his groundbreaking contributions.

🇮🇳 Return to India & Nation-Building
Returned to India during World War II and started working at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, under C.V. Raman.

Realized the need for advanced research institutions in India and proposed setting up a world-class institute.

🏗️ Institution Builder
Founded the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 1945 with support from the Tata Trust.

Established the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (later renamed Bhabha Atomic Research Centre - BARC).
